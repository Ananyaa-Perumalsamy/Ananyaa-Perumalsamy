Hi! I'm Ananyaa, a Computer Science Engineering student with a passion for coding, problem-solving, and technology innovation. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve worked on a variety of projects, honing my skills in areas like software development, data analysis, and AI.
I also enjoy exploring data analysis techniques and have worked with tools like Power BI to conduct geographical and performance benchmarking analyses.
I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to push my technical boundaries. Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss tech trends or collaborate on exciting projects!
