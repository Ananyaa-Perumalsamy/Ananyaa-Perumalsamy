Hi! I'm Ananyaa, a Computer Science Engineering student with a passion for coding, problem-solving, and technology innovation. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve worked on a variety of projects, honing my skills in areas like software development, data analysis, and AI.
I also enjoy exploring data analysis techniques and have worked with tools like Power BI to conduct geographical and performance benchmarking analyses. My ongoing projects also include leveraging IBM Power Virtualization Center for research and analysis.
I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to push my technical boundaries. Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss tech trends or collaborate on exciting projects!
